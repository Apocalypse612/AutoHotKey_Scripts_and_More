# AutoHotKey Scripts and More
Misc. AutoHotKey Functions

## Master Tray Icon.ahk
I modified something I found on the forums with the help of AI. This will allow all .ahk scripts to be run as one tray icon. The script itself will auto-refresh if there is a change, and I also added WindowSpy back in.

Hope it's useful to someone. Btw, the .exe functionality of this is half-implemented. It "kinda" works. .exe names are truncated for some odd reason, and some other oddities.
I had to add some hard paths in here to WindowSpy and the folder that runs launcher.ahk, the latter to prevent the files within from appearing in the context menu.

I don't know coding myself, but the AI does well enough I guess. Either way, enjoy!
